help: help [-dms] [pattern ...]
    Display information about builtin commands.

    Displays brief summaries of builtin commands.  If PATTERN is
    specified, gives detailed help on all commands matching PATTERN,
    otherwise the list of help topics is printed.

    Options:
      -d	output short description for each topic
      -m	display usage in pseudo-manpage format
      -s	output only a short usage synopsis for each topic matching
    	PATTERN

    Arguments:
      PATTERN	Pattern specifiying a help topic

    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless PATTERN is not found or an invalid option is given.
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.

    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.

    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.

    Options:
        -L	force symbolic links to be followed: resolve symbolic links in
    	DIR after processing instances of `..'
        -P	use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
    	links: resolve symbolic links in DIR before processing instances
    	of `..'
        -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory
    	cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status
        -@  on systems that support it, present a file with extended attributes
            as a directory containing the file attributes

    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.
    `..' is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component
    back to a slash or the beginning of DIR.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.
exit: exit [n]
    Exit the shell.

    Exits the shell with a status of N.  If N is omitted, the exit status
    is that of the last command executed.
echo: echo [-neE] [arg ...]
    Write arguments to the standard output.

    Display the ARGs, separated by a single space character and followed by a
    newline, on the standard output.

    Options:
      -n	do not append a newline
      -e	enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes
      -E	explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes

    `echo' interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:
      \a	alert (bell)
      \b	backspace
      \c	suppress further output
      \e	escape character
      \E	escape character
      \f	form feed
      \n	new line
      \r	carriage return
      \t	horizontal tab
      \v	vertical tab
      \\	backslash
      \0nnn	the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).  NNN can be
    	0 to 3 octal digits
      \xHH	the eight-bit character whose value is HH (hexadecimal).  HH
    	can be one or two hex digits

    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless a write error occurs.
pwd: pwd [-LP]
    Print the name of the current working directory.

    Options:
      -L	print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
    	directory
      -P	print the physical directory, without any symbolic links

    By default, `pwd' behaves as if `-L' were specified.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory
    cannot be read.
